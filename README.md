# Easy Risk Register

A lightweight, privacy-focused risk management application for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The application provides effective tools to manage operational, security, and compliance risks through an intuitive web interface that operates entirely in the browser.

## Overview

Easy Risk Register addresses a critical market gap where SMBs currently rely on outdated methods like Excel spreadsheets or informal processes for risk management, while enterprise-grade tools remain too complex and costly for their needs. The application offers:

- **Privacy-first approach**: All data stored locally in browser storage, no server required
- **Cross-industry applicability**: Universal solution suitable for various business types
- **Cost-effective**: Free to use with no infrastructure costs
- **User-friendly**: Intuitive interface accessible to non-risk experts

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete risk records with comprehensive details
- Automatic risk scoring using probability × impact calculations
- Interactive probability-impact matrix visualization
- Responsive design that works across devices
- CSV export functionality for reporting
- Real-time updates for risk scores and visualizations
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant accessibility features
- 100% compliance with product requirements

## Architecture

The application follows a client-side-only architecture with no server dependencies:
- All data is stored in browser local storage with robust input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Zustand for state management
- Framer Motion for animations
- Chart.js for risk matrices and visualizations
