# Easy Risk Register

A lightweight, privacy-focused risk management application for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The application provides effective tools to manage operational, security, and compliance risks through an intuitive web interface that operates entirely in the browser.

## Overview

- **Cross-industry applicability**: Universal solution suitable for various business types
- **Cost-effective**: Free to use with no infrastructure costs
- **User-friendly**: Intuitive interface accessible to non-risk experts

## Features

- Create, edit, and delete risk records with comprehensive details
- Automatic risk scoring using probability × impact calculations
- Interactive probability-impact matrix visualization
- Responsive design that works across devices
- CSV export functionality for reporting
- Real-time updates for risk scores and visualizations

## Architecture

The application follows a client-side-only architecture with no server dependencies:
- All data is stored in browser local storage
