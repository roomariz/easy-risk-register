# Configuration Files

This directory contains agent configuration files and system definitions that define the behavior and capabilities of the AI agents in the Easy Risk Register system.

## Current Configuration

Currently, this directory is empty as the system primarily uses prompt-based configurations defined in the `prompts/` directory. As the system evolves, configuration files will be added here to manage agent behavior, settings, and system parameters.

## Planned Configuration Types

- **Agent Settings**: Individual configuration files for each agent type
- **System-wide Configuration**: Global settings that apply across all agents
- **Environment Configuration**: Settings that vary by deployment environment
- **Security Configuration**: Access controls and permission settings for agents
- **Integration Configuration**: Settings for external tool and service integrations

## File Format

Configuration files will follow industry standard formats:
- YAML for human-readable configurations
- JSON for structured data configurations
- Environment-specific files for deployment variations

The configuration system will be implemented as the agent system grows and requires more complex behavioral controls.
