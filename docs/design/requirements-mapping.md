# Easy Risk Register - Design Requirements Mapping

## Overview

This document maps the design system components and specifications to the specific requirements outlined in the product requirements document for the Easy Risk Register application. It ensures that the design system addresses all functional and non-functional requirements.

## Feature Requirements Mapping

- Form component specifications in `../design-system/components/forms.md`
- Risk form modal in `../features/risk-management/screen-states.md`
- Implementation guidelines in `../features/risk-management/implementation.md`
- Form fields include: risk description area, probability selection dropdown, impact selection, mitigation plan text area

**Acceptance Criteria Mapping**:
- Form includes fields for risk description, category, probability, impact, and mitigation plan → Implemented in RiskForm component
- Risk records can be edited or deleted with appropriate confirmation → Implemented in RiskCard component with action buttons
- Form validation prevents incomplete or invalid entries → Real-time validation in RiskForm component
- Risk categories are predefined based on common industry needs → Dropdown with predefined options in form

#### 2.1.2 Risk Scoring
**Requirement**: Automatic calculation of risk scores using probability × impact formulas
**Design Implementation**:
- Real-time calculation displayed in `../features/risk-management/implementation.md`
- Risk score visualization in card components with color coding
- Visual indicators for severity levels in `../design-system/components/cards.md`

**Acceptance Criteria Mapping**:
- Risk score is calculated using probability × impact → Implemented in RiskForm with real-time calculation
- Scores are displayed visually to indicate severity levels → Color-coded display in RiskCard component
- Calculation is updated in real-time when inputs change → Implemented in RiskForm component
- Risk score ranges are clearly defined based on a 5x5 probability-impact matrix (scores 1-25): Low: ≤3, Medium: ≤6, High: >6 → Color-coded ranges with green/yellow/red

#### 2.1.3 Risk Visualization
**Requirement**: Dynamic probability-impact matrix visualization showing all risks
**Design Implementation**:
- Risk matrix visualization component in `../features/risk-management/implementation.md`
- Responsive design for matrix in `../design-system/platform-adaptations/web.md`
- Interactive elements with click-to-view details functionality

**Acceptance Criteria Mapping**:
- Interactive matrix displays risks based on probability and impact → Implemented in visualization component
- Matrix updates in real-time as risks are added/modified → Real-time update implementation
- Risks can be color-coded based on severity → Color-coding implementation
- Matrix can be filtered by category → Filtering functionality in component

### 2.2 User Experience Features

#### 2.2.1 Responsive UI
**Requirement**: Responsive design that works across devices
**Design Implementation**:
- Responsive patterns in `../design-system/tokens/spacing.md`
- Web platform adaptations in `../design-system/platform-adaptations/web.md`
- Component-level responsive specifications in all component docs
- Breakpoints defined as: Mobile (320px-767px), Tablet (768px-1023px), Desktop (1024px+), Wide (1440px+)

**Acceptance Criteria Mapping**:
- UI is responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices → Responsive design system implemented
- All functionality is accessible across different screen sizes → All components designed responsively

#### 2.2.2 Real-time Updates
**Requirement**: Live updates for risk scores and visualization as data changes
**Design Implementation**:
- Real-time feedback specifications in `../design-system/tokens/animations.md`
- Component state management for live updates in `../features/risk-management/implementation.md`

**Acceptance Criteria Mapping**:
- Risk scores update instantly when probability or impact changes → Real-time calculation implemented
- Visualizations update without requiring page refresh → Component-based updates
- All calculations complete within 1 second of input change → Performance considerations in implementation docs

### 2.3 Data Management Features

#### 2.3.1 Local Storage Management
**Requirement**: Comprehensive data management using browser local storage
**Design Implementation**:
- Data management patterns in `../features/risk-management/implementation.md`
- Security considerations in accessibility and implementation docs

**Acceptance Criteria Mapping**:
- All risk data is stored in browser local storage → Storage management implementation
- Data persists across browser sessions → Local storage implementation
- Users can view and manage their stored data → UI for data management
- Clear warnings are provided about local storage limitations → UI messaging and warnings

## Functional Requirements Mapping

### 3.1 Risk Management Functions
- **REQ-001**: Create new risk entries with description, probability, impact, and mitigation plan → Implemented in RiskForm component
- **REQ-002**: Calculate risk score using: Probability × Impact → Real-time calculation in forms
- **REQ-003**: CRUD operations for risk entries → Implemented in risk management feature
- **REQ-004**: Display risks in interactive probability-impact matrix → Matrix visualization component
- **REQ-005**: Support filtering and sorting by criteria → Filtering and sorting functionality

### 3.3 Export and Reporting Functions
- **REQ-010**: Export risk data in CSV format → Export functionality in implementation docs

### 3.4 Data Management Functions
- **REQ-014**: Store all user data in browser local storage → Local storage implementation
- **REQ-016**: Allow users to clear all stored data with confirmation → Clear data functionality
