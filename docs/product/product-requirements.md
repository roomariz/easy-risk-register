# Easy Risk Register - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

The Easy Risk Register is a lightweight, cross-industry web application designed specifically for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) to effectively manage operational, security, and compliance risks. The application addresses a critical market gap where SMBs currently rely on outdated methods like Excel spreadsheets or informal processes for risk management, while enterprise-grade tools remain too complex and costly for their needs.

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Small and medium-sized organizations often lack structured risk management processes, exposing them to potential operational, financial, and regulatory risks. Traditional risk management tools have steep learning curves and high implementation costs, making them inaccessible to teams that need straightforward risk tracking and management capabilities. Current market solutions either offer enterprise-level complexity or lack the essential visualization and automation features necessary for effective risk oversight.

### 1.2 Solution Overview
Easy Risk Register provides a minimalist, fully client-side web application that operates entirely in the browser without requiring server infrastructure or backend dependencies. The application utilizes local storage for data security and privacy, ensuring all information remains on the user's device. This approach eliminates compliance concerns while providing enterprise-level insights through a simple, accessible interface.

### 1.3 Target Market
The primary audience includes SMB owners and managers in regulated industries (finance, healthcare, manufacturing, etc.), aged 30-50, with basic technology skills. The solution specifically targets organizations that handle risks informally but require structured tools for documentation, reporting, and compliance purposes.

### 1.4 Key Value Propositions
- Instant setup with no installations, accounts, or backend requirements
- Privacy-first approach with local data storage
- Universal cross-industry applicability
- Cost-effective solution compared to traditional enterprise tools
- User-friendly interface accessible to non-risk-experts

### 1.5 Success Metrics
- User acquisition and retention rates
- Risk assessment completion rates
- Export and reporting functionality adoption
- User satisfaction scores
