Easy Risk Register

Concept:
A lightweight, cross-industry web app that empowers small and medium-sized organizations to identify, assess, and visualize operational, security, or compliance risks — delivering enterprise-level insights without the bloat, complexity, or high costs of traditional systems.

Problem:
Many small and medium businesses (SMBs) rely on outdated methods like Excel spreadsheets or simply overlook risk management due to limited resources. Enterprise-grade tools such as Archer or ServiceNow demand steep learning curves, hefty subscriptions, and IT overhead, making them inaccessible for teams that need straightforward, actionable risk tracking.

Solution:
Easy Risk Register is a minimalist, fully client-side web app that runs entirely in the browser, using local storage for data security and zero server dependencies. It enables users to:
- Quickly add, edit, or delete risks with intuitive forms.
- Assign probability (on a 1-5 scale), impact levels (1-5 scale), and custom mitigation plans.
- Automatically compute a risk score based on probability × impact formulas.
- Visualize risks in a dynamic probability-impact matrix (e.g., a color-coded grid for quick prioritization).
- Export data to CSV for audits, meetings, or stakeholders.
- Filter and sort risks by various criteria.

Why It Works:
- Universal appeal across industries (e.g., tech, finance, healthcare, manufacturing) where risk management is essential but often neglected.
- Instant setup: No installations, accounts, or backend — deployable for free on platforms like GitHub Pages or Vercel.
- Privacy-focused: All data stays local to the user's device, reducing compliance worries.
- Scalable: Core features are simple, but expandable via plugins for domain-specific risks (e.g., cybersecurity threats, financial audits, or project delays).
- User-friendly: Clean, responsive UI with real-time updates, making it accessible for non-experts.

Current Implementation:
The application is built with the following tech stack:
- React (via Vite) for the frontend framework
- TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Framer Motion for animations
- Local storage for data persistence

Key Features Implemented:
1. Executive overview dashboard with risk summary cards
2. Interactive risk probability-impact matrix visualization
3. Risk table with spreadsheet-style view
4. Risk creation and editing forms with validation
5. Filtering and sorting capabilities
6. CSV import/export functionality
7. Mobile-responsive design
8. Demo data seeding for quick start

The application follows a component-based architecture with:
- `src/components/` - Organized UI components (layout, risk, common)
- `src/services/` - Business logic and service layer
- `src/stores/` - Zustand stores for state management
- `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions

The audience for this app is SMB owners, managers, and compliance officers who handle risks informally but need a structured tool to stay proactive, without investing in heavy enterprise software. It targets the intersection of growing businesses that value efficiency and those in regulated sectors requiring basic documentation for audits or insurance.
